# Resource Portal

This is an Open Source Resource Portal to encourage sharing of resources online. 

## Introduction

The application is built with: 

**Backend**
- Strapi (NodeJS)
- PostgreSQL

The backend can be hosted on any platform that allows NodeJS 12.0 and above. It requires a standalone instance of Postgres i.e. this is not an image that will provide a database out of the box.

For storage of images, we use any S3 compatible platforms. We have currently tested it on [Digital Ocean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/), but it should work well with [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/)

**Frontend**
- [Quasar (Vue)](https://quasar.dev)


We recommend reading our Wiki (coming soon) for more information.
